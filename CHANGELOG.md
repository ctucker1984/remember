# Changelog

All notable changes to reMember are listed here. The current plugin version is in `remember.php` (`REMEMBER_VERSION`) and [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ctucker1984/remember/releases).

## Unreleased

- **Enhancement:** After public registration, the new member is signed in, sees a short confirmation that the profile was received, and is sent to the membership dashboard.
- **Enhancement:** When Allergies is anything other than None, a required explanation of the reaction appears immediately after that field. None hides it and does not require it.

## 2.1.8

- **Fix:** Interests is posted as marker text with no angle brackets, then turned back into bold, italic, underline, lists, paragraphs, and line breaks in PHP. A host firewall that blocks HTML in the form body no longer rejects the profile save.

## 2.1.7

- **Fix:** Email links for `{profile_url}`, `{vetting_url}`, `{review_url}`, and `{ticket_url}` stay a single absolute URL. A rich-text link saved as `http://{profile_url}` no longer becomes `http://https//…`.
- **Fix:** “On Member Join” opens a vetting case when someone registers. A blank workflow setting no longer skips the case, and an older vetting table that still requires a vetter is updated so the case can be saved with nobody assigned.
- **Enhancement:** An event can optionally set when registration opens and closes. Blank means that side is unlimited, so existing events stay open. Members cannot apply outside the window. Times use the site timezone.
- **Fix:** Interests keeps only bold, italic, underline, lists, paragraphs, and line breaks. The editor drops every other tag when the field is left and again before the form is posted, so Word and other paste markup is not saved.

## 2.1.6

- **Enhancement:** Report filters on multi-select fields include **is not** and **is not one of**. That covers dietary restrictions, allergies, roles, and custom multi-select questions. A row matches when its list does not include the chosen value or values, including rows whose list is empty.
- **Fix:** Member dashboard **Browse Events** opens the Events page instead of reloading the dashboard.
- **Enhancement:** Settings can auto-apply a member’s open Xero credit notes to each new invoice before it is emailed. Oldest note first, up to the invoice total. If allocation fails, the invoice stays in Xero and is not emailed.
- **Enhancement:** Each open Xero credit note is a row on the member billing register and the admin billing register, including when the member has no invoice yet. Current Balance subtracts only the still-unallocated remainder. After the note is applied, that amount stays on the invoice and the open row drops off, so it is not counted twice.
- **Fix:** On the event application, “Check your profile…” opens in a new tab so the form stays put. Return to Dashboard and Cancel go to the member dashboard.
- **Fix:** Voiding a Xero invoice shows Xero’s validation reason. Credit already allocated to that invoice is removed first, so the credit note stays available and the invoice can be voided. An invoice with a payment is left alone, with a message to remove the payment or choose Refund.

## 2.1.5

- **Fix:** Interests keep bold, italic, underline, lists, and paragraphs. Paste from ChatGPT, Word, Google Docs, LibreOffice, Pages, and other editors is reduced to `b`, `em`, `u`, `ul`, `ol`, `li`, `p`, and `br` with no attributes, in the same block layout TinyMCE posts when that text is typed in the editor. The browser sends that HTML.

## 2.1.4

- **Fix:** The profile-photo framing circle on iPhone (and other WebKit) now shows the full photo at the chosen zoom, not a sliver in the corner. Save was already using the correct crop; the preview was clipped because the image was positioned with CSS `transform` inside a round `overflow: hidden` box.
- **Enhancement:** The Members list shows each member’s roles as badges (event roles in blue, system roles in amber), matching the profile.
- **Fix:** Narrow Members cards use both sides of the row: display name and legal name, then role badges, then phone and email, then status and “Joined:” with the date and View Profile on the right. The desktop table column order is unchanged.

## 2.1.3

- **Fix:** Interests keeps rich text but strips Word/Office junk (mso styles, `o:p`, comments) on paste and save so the POST is normal HTML.
- **Enhancement:** Notification emails send as HTML. Settings → Notifications uses a visual editor for each body; existing plain-text templates become paragraphs and URLs are clickable.

## 2.1.2

- **Fix:** Completing a vetting case now emails the member the result. Accepted uses **Member Vetted**; rejected uses a new **Member Rejected** template. Those templates existed but were never sent.
- **Enhancement:** reMember System Administrators are emailed on every new member (public registration, Add Member, and convert WordPress user). Settings → Notifications → General.
- **Fix:** Dashboard **Check again** drops the GitHub release cache so it talks to GitHub immediately. New GitHub releases are also overlaid on WordPress’s 12-hour plugin list (GitHub snapshot kept 15 minutes) so an update appears without waiting.

## 2.1.1

- **Fix:** Time zone pickers use a short city list (US first, then UK / France, then the rest of the world) instead of WordPress’s full IANA dump. Stored ids stay IANA; an already-saved zone that is not in the list still appears. Help text names the organization’s WordPress time zone and why picking your own matters. Closes [#38](https://github.com/ctucker1984/remember/issues/38).

## 2.1.0

- **Enhancement:** Staff-only **Reports** in wp-admin (`View Reports`). Pick a subject (members, applications, payments, vetting, events), columns, filters, and optional grouping/totals; preview runs over AJAX; CSV export is separate. Saved reports are per user. Field catalog and query compiler enforce the same read, attendees-only, emergency-contact, and health gates as member lists and CSV. Custom profile questions appear as columns on members and applications. Database 2.2.0.
- **Enhancement:** Reports builder uses labeled fields, a header Run control, and less nested boxing so the screen sits closer to the rest of wp-admin without a wall of fieldsets.
- **Enhancement:** Report filters use the field’s choice list for custom select/multi-select questions and for catalog fields (dietary, allergies, medical, roles, clothing sizes, IM type, event role, location).
- **Enhancement:** Multi-select custom field answers print as comma-separated option keys in the results grid and CSV, not as JSON arrays.
- **Enhancement:** Reports can be limited to one event at run time without saving that event on the report. Members and vetting use accepted participants; applications and payments use that event’s records.
- **Enhancement:** Copy a saved report into another staff member’s library. The recipient must have View Reports, the subject’s read cap, and emergency/health access if the report uses those fields. The copy is theirs; the run-time event is not copied.
- **Enhancement:** **My Reports** lists saved reports A–Z by name.
- **Enhancement:** Import/Export can download and restore a full JSON backup of plugin tables and settings (not WordPress users). Restore matches users by email or creates Subscribers with random passwords, so a backup can be loaded onto a fresh install. Restore is refused if this site’s plugin or database version is older than the backup. The CSV tools on that screen are condensed; column notes sit behind each card.
- **Security:** The JSON backup omits billing client secrets, OAuth tokens, and encryption keys. Payment rows keep invoice IDs rather than downloaded payment/refund lines; QuickBooks customer and Xero contact IDs travel in the user index so a restored site can reconnect and rematch.
- **Enhancement:** New profile photos and location logos are stored under `uploads/remember/photos/` and `uploads/remember/locations/` (still not Media Library attachments). Existing files stay where they are until replaced. Ticket logos stay in Media.
- **Enhancement:** Location logos can be chosen from the Media Library or uploaded as a new file. Clearing a library-picked logo does not delete the Media file.
- **Enhancement:** Plugins → Deactivate leaves reMember data in place and offers a JSON backup first. Plugins → Delete (only after deactivate) runs uninstall: tables, settings, logs, stored photos, setup pages, and reMember capabilities are removed; WordPress users are not.
- **Security:** Saving a role’s capabilities immediately recalculates WordPress caps for every member who holds that role. Previously those users kept the old caps until their profile was saved.

## 2.0.0

- **Enhancement:** Applying for an event first shows a dialog: review and save the profile (changes optional), then return to the application. The “my profile is current” confirmation remains required. Closes [#33](https://github.com/ctucker1984/remember/issues/33).
- **Enhancement:** Settings → Notifications uses sub-tabs (Vetting, Applications, Billing, General) instead of one long list.
- **Enhancement:** Staff can append profile notes on a member record, separate from vetting case notes. Notes are either visible to the member on their profile or private to wp-admin (not shown on the member front end). Confidential print includes them; the event card does not. Database 2.0.0. Closes [#34](https://github.com/ctucker1984/remember/issues/34).
- **Enhancement:** Daily duplicate-profile scan (legal names, location, display names, IM/social handles). City and state count as one location match so same-town pairs do not flood. Staff with **Merge Duplicate Profiles** get a review link (seeded to System Administrator; grant it on Roles; WordPress administrators keep full access). reMember System Administrators are emailed new hits; members are emailed only after a merge (no other-profile data). Admins pick field values and which roles survive (roles they cannot assign stay on the remaining profile only if it already had them). Emergency contact is hidden without Access Emergency Contact; the remaining profile keeps its existing values. The later-entered password is always kept; merged (locked) profiles cannot request a password reset. After merge, the discarded profile is locked out, leftover pending reviews of it are closed, and the merge can be undone (edits to the remaining profile after the merge are lost; members are not emailed). Pairs can be marked not-duplicates so they do not re-flag. Database 2.1.0–2.1.3. Closes [#35](https://github.com/ctucker1984/remember/issues/35).

## 1.4.0

- **Enhancement:** Clothing sizes keep the member’s actual size and show the inventory size that is available. Settings → Clothing has a write-in Stock table per category; **Available as** is filled from that, not the seeded body-size list. Dropdowns and staff views use labels like `XL (available L)`. Quantity is a later table related to Stock. Database 1.41.0. Closes [#31](https://github.com/ctucker1984/remember/issues/31).
- **Fix:** Hide the Bluehost plugin’s “Login with Bluehost” button on `wp-login.php` so members use username and password. Does not replace WordPress login or block Bluehost Account Manager → Log in to WordPress. Filter `remember_hide_hosting_sso` to keep the button.
- **Enhancement:** Nonced front-end Log out via Appearance → Menus (reMember box), a **Log out** block in the Site Editor Navigation, a Custom Link to `/remember-logout`, or `[remember_logout]`. The admin bar is hidden when the only WordPress role is Subscriber; other WP roles still see it. reMember roles do not affect the bar.
- **Enhancement:** Members can change their password on Edit Profile (current, new, confirm under Basic Information) with Save Profile. Leave the fields blank to keep the current password. Closes [#27](https://github.com/ctucker1984/remember/issues/27).
- **Security:** Event apply builds add-on names/descriptions and role labels as text, not HTML, so a product name cannot run markup in the member's browser. The dashboard already escaped these in PHP.
- **Security:** CSV exports prefix cells that start with `=`, `+`, `-`, or `@` so Excel/LibreOffice will not treat member-controlled text as a formula. Re-import strips that prefix so phones and IM handles round-trip.
- **Security:** Browser security headers on front, login, admin, and REST: `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`, `Referrer-Policy`, HSTS on HTTPS, and a WordPress-compatible Content-Security-Policy. Filter `remember_security_headers` to tighten or disable. Does not replace headers the host already sends.
- **Security:** Unauthenticated `GET /wp-json/wp/v2/users` no longer returns login slugs. Editors/admins still can (block editor); everyone else gets 401.
- **Security:** XML-RPC stays available for Jetpack and the WordPress mobile app (`system.multicall` included). Pingback methods, the X-Pingback header, and open pings are removed (SSRF). Multicall brute-force is a server concern (fail2ban / rate-limit / WAF), not a plugin 403.
- **Security:** Debug logs no longer write to the public `/wp-content/debug.log` URL. reMember stores them in a web-blocked uploads directory, Apache/LiteSpeed deny HTTP GET of `debug.log`, and PHP’s error_log is redirected there when `WP_DEBUG_LOG` is the boolean default.
- **Enhancement:** Interests is limited to 2,000 characters (plain text) on registration, profile edit, and admin member edit, with a live counter. Closes [#29](https://github.com/ctucker1984/remember/issues/29).

## 1.3.7

- **Enhancement:** The event card printout uses a larger square photo at top left, with the display name and the first four opted-in custom fields in the column beside it. Remaining event-card fields continue in two columns under that row, then Interests.
- **Enhancement:** Assigned member numbers print on both sheets: under the display name on the confidential profile and the event card, and in the confidential footer.
- **Fix:** Member billing register follows Xero/QBO invoice totals: voided or deleted invoices are cancelled locally (zero balance, no ghost debit), deleted payments and credit notes drop off on sync, and remaining credits (Xero AmountCredited / QBO credit memos) are applied so Current Balance matches the provider.
- **Fix:** Opening a member profile always refreshes invoices, payments, and credits from Xero or QuickBooks (no 60-second cache).
- **Fix:** Settings → Xero shows **Reconnect Xero** while a connection is stored, and warns when the access token can no longer be refreshed. Previously only Disconnect was offered, so an expired token looked connected with no way to authorize again.
- **Fix:** Xero reconnect keeps the authorization error on the Xero tab (it was a 60-second flash notice), uses a stored OAuth state plus PKCE, and exchanges the code with the same redirect URI that started the flow so a completed reconnect actually replaces the tokens.
- **Fix:** Xero token exchange, refresh, and revoke send the same User-Agent as other Xero calls. identity.xero.com was returning HTTP 403 (Akamai) for WordPress’s default user-agent, which blocked reconnect and left the stored tokens expired. A failed reconnect notice is cleared once the live connection works again.

## 1.3.6

- **Enhancement:** Member profiles print in two formats, chosen from a **Print** menu on the profile. *Confidential profile* is the full staff record — identity, profile, emergency contact, and health on page one, interests and custom fields on page two — with red CONFIDENTIAL banners repeated on every page. *Event card* is meant for posting at an event: photo, display name, interests, and opted-in custom fields, with no contact details, address, roles, emergency contact, or health information. wp-admin chrome, action buttons, vetting cases, and the billing register stay off both. Save-as-PDF filenames use `{display_name}_member_full_profile_{yymmdd}.pdf` and `{display_name}_event_card_{yymmdd}.pdf`.
- **Enhancement:** Custom profile fields gain a **Show on event card** setting on the Custom Profile Fields screen, off by default, so a question like "What medications do you take?" never reaches a publicly posted card unless you opt it in. The flag round-trips through the custom fields CSV. Database 1.35.0.
- **Security:** Emergency contact and health information (dietary, allergies, medical) are gated behind `remember_access_emergency_contact` and `remember_access_health` (shown as Access Emergency Contact / Access Health Information). Without those caps, the fields are hidden on member view/edit, omitted from member and event CSV exports, and ignored on import and forged POSTs. Default grants: System Administrator and Vetting get both; Event Administrator gets health only (for event planning). Database 1.36.0; renamed from `remember_read_*` in 1.37.0.
- **Enhancement:** Role capability editing uses a module × Create/Read/Edit/Delete matrix, with settings, exports, emergency contact, and health listed under Other.
- **Security:** The member profile's billing register honors `remember_read_billing`. Staff without it (Vetting, for example) saw the full invoice, payment, and refund ledger with the running balance, even though the Billing screen was already hidden from them; the ledger is no longer built or rendered for them, and the QuickBooks/Xero sync buttons and their POST handlers now also require `remember_update_billing`. Vetting cases on the profile likewise require `remember_read_vetting`.
- **Security:** Privilege escalation hardening — role capability saves require `remember_update_roles` (the bare `update_capabilities` path had none), you can only grant caps you already hold, System Administrator cannot be deleted or edited except by a WordPress administrator, and member role assignment cannot add or remove roles whose caps you do not hold. Application billing mutations (invoice create on accept, reprocess, unwind/void) and payment UI require billing caps. Member CSV export respects attendees-only scoping. Mutation UI (Add Member, Accept/Decline, etc.) is hidden when the matching cap is missing.
- **Fix:** "None" sorts first in dietary, allergy, and medical accommodation checklists (profile, registration, and admin edit). Database 1.38.0.
- **Fix:** The member profile's top row sizes itself to the cards the viewer may see. Staff without emergency contact or health access no longer get a third-width profile card with empty space beside it.
- **Fix:** The confidential printout no longer strands the dietary/allergy/medical cards below the profile card with a dead gap after Emergency Contact. Emergency contact and health now share one column that stacks tightly beside the profile (the old layout leaned on a grid row span that collapses without explicit rows). The event card is unaffected.
- **Security:** Member profile printing is gated by `remember_print_confidential` and `remember_print_event_card` (Print Confidential Profile / Print Event Card). Without the matching cap the Print control is hidden, Ctrl/Cmd+P yields a permission notice instead of the sheet, and each format is offered only when allowed. Seeded to System Administrator and Event Administrator (not Vetting). Database 1.39.0.
- **Fix:** Settings → Plugin Version reports the installed files (`REMEMBER_VERSION`), and the stored `remember_version` option is synced on admin load after Upload → Replace. Silent reactivation was leaving the option on the previous release.

## 1.3.5

- **Enhancement:** Updates arrive in the WordPress dashboard. reMember checks GitHub Releases and offers the packaged `remember-x.y.z.zip`, so Plugins → Update works like any other plugin (requires WordPress 5.8+).
- **Fix:** Every rich-text field is Visual-only — the Visual/Code switcher is gone from events, locations, agreements, member edit, registration, and profile.

## 1.3.4

- **Enhancement:** Admin-assignable unique alphanumeric member number; members see it read-only. Closes [#21](https://github.com/ctucker1984/remember/issues/21).
- **Enhancement:** Event apply and dashboard application edits require profile-currency confirmation (phrase + profile saved within 24 hours); profile `updated_by` audit fields. Closes [#22](https://github.com/ctucker1984/remember/issues/22).
- **Fix:** Interests editors (profile, registration, admin) show Visual only — Code tab hidden.
- **Fix:** Long profile edit forms no longer clip custom fields or force horizontal overflow.
- **Fix:** Upload → Replace no longer fails on git/dev trees (`.git`, `dist`, etc.): deactivate earlier, purge non-release paths, chmod writable, retry clear when WordPress reports `files_not_writable`.

## 1.3.3

- **Security:** Attendees-only staff can no longer open arbitrary member profiles via `?view=` ID; detail and POST actions use the same shared-event scope as the list.
- **Security:** Setup wizard, Settings, and Products mutations re-check `remember_access_settings` (not nonce alone).
- **Fix:** Applications-only staff can open the admin dashboard (menu and page caps aligned).
- **Fix:** Event-role AJAX uses separate admin/front nonces; no longer trusts Referer or `manage_options` for the full role list.
- **Fix:** Staff ticket viewing uses `remember_read_applications` (replaced undefined `remember_view_applications`).
- **Enhancement:** Admin-managed Instant Messenger platforms (DB 1.32.0); Social Media + IM combined in a two-column **Platforms** settings tab. Closes [#20](https://github.com/ctucker1984/remember/issues/20).

## 1.3.2

- **Fix:** Country is required on registration and profile (defaults to US). Closes [#17](https://github.com/ctucker1984/remember/issues/17).
- **Enhancement:** Interests prompt asks what the member wants from the event. Closes [#16](https://github.com/ctucker1984/remember/issues/16).
- **Fix:** Time zone starts empty at registration and opens unfiltered; clearer importance copy. Closes [#13](https://github.com/ctucker1984/remember/issues/13).
- **Enhancement:** Dietary, medical, and allergy catalogs include None and require a response. Closes [#15](https://github.com/ctucker1984/remember/issues/15).
- **Enhancement:** Expanded allergies seed list (incl. pomegranate, grapefruit). Closes [#19](https://github.com/ctucker1984/remember/issues/19).
- **Enhancement:** Expanded dietary restrictions and medical accommodations for event planning coverage.
- **Enhancement:** Privacy copy explains sharing and encourages photo + IM for networking. Closes [#18](https://github.com/ctucker1984/remember/issues/18).
- **Enhancement:** Profile photo required at registration. Closes [#14](https://github.com/ctucker1984/remember/issues/14).
- **Enhancement:** Custom profile fields can be required only when an earlier pick-one / pick-several field matches chosen values. Closes [#11](https://github.com/ctucker1984/remember/issues/11).
- **Fix:** Load `dbDelta` before admin schema migrations so upgrades are not stalled mid-chain.
- **Fix:** Admin mobile — vetting, applications, billing, and related tables stack into labeled cards. Closes [#8](https://github.com/ctucker1984/remember/issues/8), [#9](https://github.com/ctucker1984/remember/issues/9), [#10](https://github.com/ctucker1984/remember/issues/10).
- **Chore:** Plugin header `Update URI` points at the GitHub repository.

## 1.3.1

- **Fix:** Custom fields on registration/profile no longer collide with the two-column register layout. Closes [#6](https://github.com/ctucker1984/remember/issues/6).
- **Fix:** Admin mobile layout — member/event headers stack; wide tables scroll on small screens. Closes [#7](https://github.com/ctucker1984/remember/issues/7).
- **Docs:** Slim root README; remove planning markdown from the release tree.

## 1.3.0

- Upload → Replace safely deactivates/reactivates the plugin during zip upgrades.
- Custom profile fields (text / single / multi-select); registration and profile.
- Agreements library with pinned event revisions and typed legal-name acknowledgement on apply.
- Allow reapply for declined/cancelled applications.
- Leaner admin member-edit required fields.
- Event participant CSV export (accepted applications).
- Import/Export capability; richer member CSV; custom fields definition import/export.

## 1.2.0

- Printable admission tickets and receipts; email on accept / paid / balance due.
- Rich text for locations, event description, Interests; registration/profile polish; per–role add-on max qty.
- Billing: email Xero/QBO invoice on accept; credit-note sync; release zip packaging (`remember/` root folder).

## 1.1.x

- Registration and admin photo cropper; Xero customer invoice links on the member register; safer payment sync; release packaging fixes.

## 1.1.0

- Billing provider selector (none / QuickBooks / Xero); full Xero path parallel to QuickBooks.

## 1.0.x

- Baseline: members, events, applications, vetting, QBO billing, roles, locations, products, shortcodes; display-name / privacy / convert-WP-user refinements in 1.0.1.
